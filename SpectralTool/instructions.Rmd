# What is this for?
This set of tools and scripts is used to streamline work with spectra (mostly ATR-FTIR and UV/VIS). It should cover everything from handling raw spectra, preprocessing, reshaping tables and various types of analysis.

# Contents
- `omnic_breakoff.py`

# omnic_breakoff.py
This python script is used to batch prepare spectra for use in Open Specy spectral processing tool. Files is .csv format exported from Thermo's OMNIC software lack the header. OMNIC also exports whole range of instrument, meaning that if we analysed certain wavenumber range we will have extra data we don't need.

# Open Specy processing
Open Specy is free and open-sorce R-package for spectral processing that also has a [web app](https://openanalysis.org/openspecy/). Files made by `omnic_brakeoff.py` should be importable as such into the webb app and analysed there. When spectra had been analysed, it will be bulk exported, so `openspecy_splitter.py` should be used in order to provide input files for the Fityk.

# Checking correlation within replicates and/or central points
One of the main issues with spectral data and multivariate analysis is reproducibility. In order to assertain reproducibilizy it is usefull to check degree of which spectra of the samples with same parameters are correlated with each other. Poor similarity between said spectra indicates that our system is not under control and all othher statistical analysis can not be certain.

Some of the approaches for assertaining the similarity:
- PCA
- Covariance
- Pearson's correlation
- Spectrum Angle Mapping (SAM)
- t-tests and p-value chart

# RainbowSpectrum
Rainbow spectrum is nice visual representation of regions of spectra responsibile for variations between samples.It takes values of loadings from PCA and plots it as third axis (gradient line) on mean spectra of the samples. At present, Loadings are taken from Sartorius SIMCA software, and later we shoud be able to do this within R using `pca.r` script.
