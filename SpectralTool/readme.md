# What is SpectralTool
SpectralTool is collection of tools for dealing with spectral data. This covers scripts for filtering and trimming datasets, preprocessing, multivariate analysis and visual representations.

# What models are currently being worked on?
For now there are scripts for:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - both in base R and FactoMineR package
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) 
- Partial Least Sqares Regression (PLSR)
- Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA)

We are planning to add:
- Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Multiblock analysis
